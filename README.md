# Auto-Mouse
Automate Mouse movement every X minutes for how many hours you want.

Note: Use Spyder to run this instead of jupyter notebook
      While running the code, make sure that there is a blank excel spreadsheet at the background.
      This is so that you are able to see the mouse moves and clicks, which indicates the code is running.
      Modules you will need to install prior are pyautogui, time, datetime and sys
